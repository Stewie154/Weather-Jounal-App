 Project 3 of Udacity front-end course

I found this project to be challenging, as I hadn't worked with api calls before. It was great practice for me though, to get my head around a real example of how retrieving and displaying data can be done. I used the lessons from the udacity course as a reference throughout the project, this helped to give me some structure while building. This project has given me a good grounding in how to work with an api.
